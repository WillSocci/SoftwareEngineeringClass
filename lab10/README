This is my lab10! To start off you will need to download python and flask.
In order to run my tests you will need these commands and instructions:

In one terminal enter this to open the port:

cd lab10
python3 my-server.py


In a brand new terminal enter this to run the unittests:


cd lab10
python test/test.py


to run the my-calls.py:

python my-calls.py
