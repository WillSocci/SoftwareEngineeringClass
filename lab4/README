This is my lab4! To start off you will need to download python and flask.
In order to run my tests you will need these commands and instructions:

1.) first open up a terminal, and in the terminal run these:

2.)
  cd lab4
  python3 c/app.py

that opens up the port and allows connection to happen.

3.) then open up a brand new terminal and enter these to compile and run the tests:

4.)
  cd lab4
  javac -cp ".:../junit-4.13.2.jar:../hamcrest-core-1.3.jar" u/unitTests.java
  java -cp ".:../junit-4.13.2.jar:../hamcrest-core-1.3.jar" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore u.unitTests

****IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK THE app.py 5000 PORT MUST BE RUNNING**** (step2)
