This is my lab9! To start off you will need to download python and flask.
In order to run my tests you will need these commands and instructions:

In one terminal enter this to open the port:

cd lab9
python3 my_server.py

In a brand new terminal enter this to run the unittests:

cd lab9
python test.py


to run the my-calls.py:

python my-calls.py
